	--   Please only ever modify the part to the right of '::'.

	--   In all texts, '|' indicates a linebreak for the game.

	--   The game replaces instances of $0, $1, etc with relevant numbers.

	--   instances of (s) are replaced with an 's' if the number associated is above 1, otherwise it is simply removed. The following alternatives are supported: (you can still use (s) if relevant)
	--   (es) for Spanish
	--   (y) for Polish
	--   (и) for Ukrainian
	--   (n), (er) and (e) for German
	--   Additionally if none of these are helpful you can set a word between braces to tell the game to replace it according to a specific pluralization rule you specified at the end of this file. For example instead of writing "$0 man(s)" which makes no sense, I would write "$0 [man]" and the game will know to replace it with either "man" or "men" (defined at the very end of this file) depending on whether $0 is replaced with a 1 or something above. Make sure to write the singular version of the word inside the braces.
	--   Even more specific pluralization rules can be defined at the end of this file, including rules for specific numbers.
	--   In all cases outside of percentages, all numbers can safely be assumed to be below 10. For unnumberred plurals, (eg: knight(s) get +2 HP) the game always uses the number 999 internally.

black_bishop::Alfil Beltza:

	--   Black Bishop:
dialogue_tuto_1_1::Berorren maiestate, denengandik baztertua izan zarete, ni bakarrik geratzen naiz laguntzeko eta aholkatzeko. Atzera-egite taktiko bat iradoki dezaket?
	--   [White bishop appears]
	--   Black king:
dialogue_tuto_1_2::Traidore!!! Tentel itxura daukazu!
	--   Black bishop:
dialogue_tuto_1_3::Jauna, tamalez,  aurrera jarraitzeko ahulegiak gara. Mezedez, gaztelura itzul gaitezen.
	--   B King:
dialogue_tuto_1_4::Ondo, goazen. Izan ere, egoera honi aurre egiteko ideia bat bururatu zait.
	--   [Both get into the castle. Next screen is in a room with a shotgun on a pedestral.]
	--   B King:
dialogue_tuto_2_1::Hor dago, nire zerbitzari leialagoa…
	--   B Bishop:
dialogue_tuto_2_2::Jauna? ¿Zer… egin nahi duzue?
	--   B King:
dialogue_tuto_2_3::Nire Eskopeta Erreala!!! Ea zer aurpegi jartzen duten traidore kakanarru horiek.
	--   B Bishop: (distressed)
dialogue_tuto_2_4::Berorren maiestate, arren eskatzen dizuet… Nire ustean, hau gehiegikeria da, ezin dut proposamen hau babestu.
	--   B King:
dialogue_tuto_2_5::Panpin aho hori itxi eta hemen geratu. Ez zaitut ez zu ez zure onarpena behar.
	--   [Back outside in front of the castle. A white rook is there.]
	--   B King: (can replace this line with any sort of gratuitous threat that plays on words with the rook piece or with the castle in the background)
dialogue_tuto_3_1::Eh, zu! Bai, zu, dorrekasto! Nire harresiak ikustera etorri al zara?! Hurbildu, erakutsiko dizut zerbait!!
	--   B King, after shooting once at the rook, needs to reload their shotgun:
dialogue_tuto_3_2::Adreilu pilo tentela, kargatzera behartuko nauzu?
	--   B King has killed the rook, and now two knights come onto the board.
	--   B King: (snarky remark on knights' weird L-shape movement in chess)
dialogue_tuto_4_1::Ah, hemen dator zalditeri erreala. Lerro zuzenean mugitzeko gai al zarete jada, astropoto alakoak?
	--   B Bishop, explaining you can see enemy piece's info in the interface.
dialogue_tuto_4_2::Maiestate, aurreko mandekoei buruzko informazioa bildu dizuet, ezagutu ditzazue. Informazio honen artean, haien mugimenduak, abiadura eta BPak (Bizitza Puntuak) daude.
	--   B King: (callback to the first time the king told the bishop to shut up)
dialogue_tuto_4_3::Ez al nizun esan panpin aho hori itxita izatea?
	--   Both knights are blown to pieces by the Black King.
	--   B King:
dialogue_tuto_powerup::Ez dago bolbora errea bezalako usain hobeagorik zure mendeko traidoreak suntsitu ondoren! Gero eta biziago sentitzen naiz!
	--   The white king and queen come onto the board with a few pawns.
	--   B King: (lead hail refers to the shotgun's pellets. can replace this with any vaguely threatening pun/joke about rival royalty)
dialogue_tuto_5_1::Begira! Agurtu dezagun Bikote Erreala! Agurtuko zaituztet, bai, baina… tiroka! Kar, kar!!!
	--   Still B King, to himself: ("gets it" = dies. Needs to convey that the white side will give up if their king dies)
dialogue_tuto_5_2::Ziur koldar hauek nire belarditik ihes egingo dutela beraien errege zuri kuttuna erortzen denean…
	--   The B King defeats the small white army.
	--   Narrator, with illustrations: (continuation from vig_1, to be found further below, which is actually displayed at the start of the tutorial, and this is shown after the tutorial is completed)
	--   (the "claim over thyne former subjects' souls" is about the game's mechanic of stealing piece's souls when they die to move like them.)
	--   (B Bishop prophesizes that the B King anger will lead him to his demise)
vig_2_tuto::Armada zuria garaituta, Alfil Beltza Errege Beltzarengana hurbildu zen, bere dimisioa aurkeztu eta hau esan zion: «Inoiz egondako errege txarrenetarikoa izan zarete, baina zuen erreinua oraindik sakratua da. Lehen izandako menpekoen arimak, oraindik zuenak dira, hau dela eta, ezin gara zuen haserreaz are gehiago beldurtu. Ondorioz, adi egon nire oharpenarekin: “Gizon baten haserrea, ahaltsua izanda ere, beti da haren galbidea”».
vig_3_tuto::Eta horrela, Errege Beltza bakarrik geratu zen, guztiengandik aldenduta, ezta dorre bakar bat bere izenean. Bere eskopeta erreala geratzen zitzaion soilik, bere duintasunaren zirimolak eta amorru profetizatuaren eta amorru profetizatuaren handiagoa. «Haserrea nire galbidea izango dela?! Galbidea dio! Zerbait galtzeko egoeran egongo banintz!». Bere erotasun ilunean, Erregeak bere eskopeta kargatu zuen behin gehiagoz eta bere azken partida jokatzera joan zen.

	--   STORIES
	--   Intro to throne mode (vig_1 is also used for the tutorial, and the tutorial ends with a variation of vig_2 and vig_3)
vig_1::Errege Beltza gobernari bitxi eta ezatsegina izan zen. Urteak joan urteak etorri, Errege Zuriak gero eta menpeko gehiago lortzen joan zen, soldata altuagoak eta lan duinak eskaintzen zizkienak. Egun batean, bere gaztelua erasotu zuten. Bere zaldunek uko egin zioten zerbitzatzen jarraitzeari. Bere emaztea ere, Erregina, utzi egin zion.
vig_2::Alde egin baino lehen, azken Alfil Beltza berarengana hurbildu eta hala esan zion: «Egondako erregerik txarrenetarikoa izan zarete, baina zuen erreinua sakratua da oraindik. Lehen izandako menpekoen arimak, oraindik zuenak dira, hau dela eta, ezin gara zuen haserreaz are gehiago beldurtu. Beraz, adi egon nire oharpenarekin prestad atención a mi advertencia: “Gizon baten haserrea, ahaltsua izanda ere, beti da haren galbidea”».
vig_3::Eta horrela, Errege Beltza bakarrik geratu zen, guztiengandik aldenduta, ezta dorre bakar bat bere izenean. Bere eskopeta erreala geratzen zitzaion soilik, bere duintasunaren zirimolak eta amorru profetizatuaren eta amorru profetizatuaren handiagoa. «Haserrea nire galbidea izango dela?! Galbidea dio! Zerbait galtzeko egoeran egongo banintz!». Bere erotasun ilunean, Erregeak bere eskopeta kargatu zuen behin gehiagoz eta bere azken partida jokatzera joan zen.

	--   Transition to the boss big white king. Yes, light swears are okay, for what it's worth the game's ESRB rating is Everyone 10+.
vig_4::Hainbeste urtez lortutako menekoak... Hainbeste lan ongi etorriak eta seguruak senti zezaten... Dena eskopetadun errege psikopata batek ezertara murrizteko. Errege Zuriak ez zuen hau onartuko, ez solairu bat gehiagoz. Literalki amorruz lehertuta, guduan agertu zen maniako berekoi hura zapaltzeko.
	--   Variant for when the Theocracy card is in play. The White King takes back the rule from the bishops.
vig_5::Hainbeste urtez lortutako menekoak... Hainbeste lan ongi etorriak eta seguruak senti zezaten... Dena eskopetadun errege psikopata batek ezertara murrizteko. Errege Zuriak ezin zuen hau onartu eta utzi Konklabak bere erreinua hondamendira eraman. Literalki amorruz lehertuta, guduan agertu zen maniako berekoi hura zapaltzeko.

	--   Normal win
vig_6::Eta horrela, Errege Beltzaren haserreak garaipenera eraman zion. Orain berari zegokion gaztelua eta Errege Zuriaren menpekoak lapurtzea! Bere gobernu zakarra jasan beharko zuten beste behin...
vig_7::"Poztu zaitezte! Gutxienez, ez zarete txiktu egin!", oihukatu zien eskopetari eusten zion bitartean barrezka. Garaitu gabea, ez zuen ezer ikasi. Ez zen denbora asko igaroko Errege Zuri berri bat agertu eta istorio osoa berriro hasi arte...

	--   SECRET ENDINGS
	--   On killing the Black Bishop:
vig_8::«Ja! Nork egin du topo bere galerarekin orain?», oihukatu zuen Eskopetadun Erregeak. Baina Alfila hil bezain laster, liburua bere eskuetatik hegan hasi eta taulatik zerura igo zen.
	--   The following is only used if a secret condition is respected of killing the bishop. Otherwise the normal ending is shown instead after this.

vig_9::"Ez hain azkar!" Bere eskopeta kargatuta, apuntatu zuen...
vig_10::... ... eta liburuari tiro egin zion, orri hautsi eta asaldatuen masa bihurtuz. "Hitz santuak? Bai zera!", esan zuen. "Ezer ez da ni eta eskopeta hau baino santuagoa!".
vig_12::"Poztu zaitezte! Gutxienez, ez zarete txiktu egin!", oihukatu zien eskopetari eusten zion bitartean barrezka."Eta orain, ediktu berri bat! Liburu gehiagorik ez! Debekatuak izango dira! Kanpora liburu sakratuak! Hemendik aurrera, zuen Jainkoa izango naiz. Eskopetaren Jainkoa!". Bere gobernua gupidagabea eta beldurgarria izango litzateke betiko.

	--   Shown after defeating the secret boss queen. ("The Blight")
	--   Should read as not-so-subtle freaky erotica. Don't use direct sexual words but lean hard into the double-entendres. Have fun with it!
	--   Don't make it too long. The original text is already quite close to the limit of what can be displayed at once.
vig_13::Garro horiek erregearen buruan geratuko ziren gauez lo egiten utzi gabe. Beso hezurgabe eta irristakor horiek gorputzean zehar nola irristatzen zitzaizkion, indarrez heldu eta estutu, bizi-indarra drainatuz... Bere onetik ateratzen zion. Erregina izaki adoretsua izan zen betidanik... Orain, Erregeak bere eskopetako kanoi hotzekin eta bere ponpaketa bakartiarekin konformatu beharko zen.
	--   Then the normal ending is shown.

	--   Shown after the black king steals a horse from one of the secret boss horsemen of the apocalypse and leaves the board.
	--   The black king found a "job opening" as a horseman of the apocalypse, leaving his old role of king.
vig_14::Asmatu, nork aurkitu du lana Bibliako mehatxu madarikatu bat bezala? Mendeko ziztrin eta alferrikakoei atsegin emateaz aspertuta, azkenean, lan bat agertu zen Erregearen dohainak zituen norbaitentzat. Ez ziren hari buruzko zantzu gehiagorik egongo, heriotza eta suntsipena bakarrik, non bere zaldi demonikoak eraman zezan. Kontuz, Satan! Eskopetaren Erregeak eskailera korporatibotik igo da.

	--   Shown after defeating the secret boss Horsemen of the Apocalypse
	--   Should mention the artifacts because they are shown in the accompanying illustration. Please do your best to translate the last joke about the horsemen's Last Judgement/Apocalypse being the black king's "thursday". (i.e. a day like any other)
vig_15::"Apokalipsiko Zaldunak? Apokalipsiko Zapalduak esango nuke nik", Esan zuen Errege Beltzak irribarrez, bere trofeo-gelan tramankuluak muntatzen zituen bitartean. Alfilak noizbehinka honi buruz egin zuen, errege-jaramon asko egin gabe, Azken Etpaiketa heraldoei buruz, Denboren Amaiera eragingo luketenak. Eta beraitentzat, baliteke Azken Epaiketa izatea, baina, Erregearentzat, beste edozein ostegun bat bezala izan zen.



	--   PLURALS
	--   This is where you define pluralization rules!
	--   The first rule defines the default behaviour for any word.
	--   If your language doesn't add 's's at the end of plural words (like in Chinese, Japanese or Korean) please set this first line to '*:s:'. (i.e.: remove the s just before the linebreak) This is very important, otherwise you'll see 's's popping up everywhere.

*:s:s

	--   For any word that is spelt differently when pluralized, use either of these syntaxes:
	--   child:s:children
	--   child:2:children
	--   Use this second version to define a puralization for a specific number. (here 2) Outside percentages the game only uses numbers below 10, so there's no need to define rules for numbers above 10. In case of unnumbered plurals (eg: "knight(s) get +2 HP") then the game internally uses the number 999. So you can write a specific rule for 999 for these cases like so:
	--   knight:999:knights
	--   Both versions of the word should be in your language. The original word should be identical to how you wrote it previously in this file, including capitalization(!).

	--   This is used for piece names (full names, not the short versions), for the translation for "shell", and for any words you might have set between braces so you could write its proper plural form here.
